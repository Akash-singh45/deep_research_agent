2.2 Workflow
The system follows a structured workflow:

Query Input: The user submits a query via main.py.
Web Search: The Tavily API retrieves relevant web content (langgraph_flow.py).
Text Cleaning: Raw data is processed using text_cleaner.py to remove noise and ensure consistency.
Data Processing: The Gemini API analyzes and summarizes the cleaned data (langgraph_flow.py).
Output Generation: The drafting agent formats the processed data into a final report (drafting_agent.py).
Result Delivery: The formatted output is returned to the user via main.py.
